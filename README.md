# EduBridge

**Learn From Others. Share What You Know. Grow Together.**

A responsive student mentorship and peer-learning starter application. This simplified version uses **Node.js + Express** and local JSON files for persistence (no SQL database required). The interface uses a professional deep-blue / charcoal palette.

## Features in this build

- Separate student and mentor registration / sign-in with role-aware navigation.
- Mentor profiles and student-facing mentor discovery/search.
- Mentor profile detail view, including resources uploaded by that mentor.
- Resource upload for both students and mentors; uploaded resources appear in the shared library, and mentor resources appear on the mentor's profile. Files up to 12 MB are supported (PDF, common images, DOC/DOCX, PPT/PPTX and TXT).
- Community doubt posting and peer replies.
- Mentorship session requests, mentor accept/decline, and completion status.
- Optional skill exchange board.
- In-platform participant-to-participant messaging.
- Basic report submission.
- Responsive dashboard tiles for mentors, doubts, resources, sessions, skill exchange, messages, reports and profile.

## Requirements

- Node.js 18 or newer
- npm

## Run locally

1. Extract the ZIP.
2. Open a terminal in the `edubridge` folder.
3. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. (Recommended) Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and set a long random `SESSION_SECRET`. The app runs with a development fallback secret if you skip this step.
5. Start the app:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

6. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

For automatic restart during development, use `npm run dev`.

## Data and uploads

- User accounts and app records are stored as JSON files in `data/`.
- Uploaded files are stored in `uploads/`.
- Both directories are created automatically. They are excluded from source control by `.gitignore`; the included `.gitkeep` files preserve the folders in the project.
- Back up `data/` and `uploads/` to preserve your local demo data.

## Important limitations

This is a local/demo starter, not a production-ready hosted service. It deliberately avoids SQL and uses simple JSON-file persistence. Do not run multiple server instances against the same JSON files. For a public deployment, replace the default in-memory session store with a persistent session store, use HTTPS, set a strong `SESSION_SECRET`, add CSRF protection and rate limiting, scan uploaded files, move uploads to private object storage, and add a real admin/moderation workflow. Mentor verification is never automatically granted; this build displays the status but does not implement administrator review. Notifications are represented by in-app workflow updates rather than email or push delivery. The simplified report flow stores reports but does not provide an admin console. Direct messaging is participant-scoped but is not end-to-end encrypted.

## Build / deployment

There is no separate frontend compilation step. `npm start` runs the Node.js server and serves the frontend from `public/`. Deploy to a Node.js 18+ host that supports persistent disk storage, configure environment variables, and ensure the `data/` and `uploads/` directories are writable. The local JSON persistence is intended for a single-instance demo; use a production database or managed data service before scaling.


## Added in the updated prototype

- Server-checked private messages are limited to the student and mentor in an accepted or completed mentorship session. The app shows only those eligible conversation partners and tracks unread messages.
- A learning hub includes 30 curated subject/exam pages, beginner-to-advanced roadmaps, links to official documentation and open course materials, and YouTube topic searches. No copyrighted PDFs are copied into this project; NCERT and provider links open the official source.
- Students can set a daily study goal, log study time, save course bookmarks, record course progress and return to recently viewed subjects. A short programming fundamentals quiz gives an immediate score.
- The course guide compares learning platforms and cautions students to verify current fees and certificate conditions directly with each provider.
- Mentor discovery links to public online mentor directories. External profiles are not represented as verified EduBridge mentors.
- `START_HERE.md` gives beginner-friendly VS Code setup and run instructions. Run `npm test` for private-message access checks.

The learning catalogue is a set of reference links, not a redistribution of course PDFs. The app remains a local JSON-file prototype; accounts and records are stored on the computer running the server, so this is not yet a shared campus deployment. Teacher/admin workflows, external notifications and attachment messaging are not included in this update.

Teachers can now register directly and participate in the shared learning resources and doubt community. Teacher role registration does not grant private-message access; messages are reserved for accepted student–mentor session pairs.

Doubt community updates now support subject/text search, recent or popular sorting, image/PDF attachments, multiple replies, helpful votes and accepted answers (by the asker or a teacher).
